                <h1>1. “Happy to help!”</h1>
                <p>Not every customer will tell you that they are walking away unhappy — in fact, few will. So it's
                    important to make sure that the customer leaves satisfied. Ending your emails without a closing
                    message can be risky as it’s not inviting the customer to share further issues — issues you
                    sincerely want to hear about.
                    For an outspoken person like myself, it was initially hard for me to understand why some people
                    might just slink away without bringing up additional problems. Maybe they don’t want to be a burden,
                    or maybe they think you don’t care. Whatever the reason, you need to let them know that you’d be
                    happy to hear them out.
                    That’s why I end 99% of my messages with, “Let me know if there’s anything else I can do for you.
                    I’m happy to help.” It’s my way of saying that it would be my pleasure to assist with any lingering
                    concerns that may have cropped up or answer any questions they may feel are silly. There are no
                    silly questions in support.</p>

                <h1>2. “I understand how (blank) that must be”</h1>
                <p>When you say, "I understand how (blank) that must be," the word you use to fill the blank will
                    greatly affect the tone of your message — one that is obviously being used with an upset customer.
                    Here’s a quick personal story: I ordered a birthday gift for a friend of mine from a hobby site.
                    Usually, I couldn’t care less about whether something ships on time; I’m patient and forgetful, the
                    perfect customer.
                    However, this order was botched beyond belief. I was charged for and sent two orders instead of one,
                    it was sent to my house when I specified my friend’s address, and as the cherry on top, it was sent
                    late. The support person’s response when I emailed in: “I understand how annoying that must be.”
                    I’m sorry, I was beyond annoyed. I was upset, and she should have known to empathize with how
                    upsetting that must be for me. Upset customers are driven by emotion — not logic — as I was in that
                    instance. I felt like I had let my friend down, and it made me frustrated in a situation I otherwise
                    would have brushed off.
                    Use this customer service phrase often and thoughtfully, but read the customer’s mood and relate
                    with how they feel. Great support is defined by genuine empathy.</p>
